# kubeflow-pipelines
 
 These Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate how to create Kubeflow pipelines and run them on Google Cloud Vertex AI Pipelines.

The Notebooks are programmed to run in a Google Cloud Project using Vertex AI Colab Enterprise. Changes would likely need to be made to run them in another environment. 

### Instructions
1. Log into the Google Cloud Console
2. Create or Open a project. 
3. Enable the Vertex AI APIs.
4. Navigate to __Vertex AI__ | __Colab Enterprise__.
5. Import the Notebooks to run them.
6. You will need to create a Cloud Storage Bucket for Pipeline Artifacts.
